# ThirdPersonUE5
Test project on UE5 from UE Third Person template. This project allows to avoid building Engine from source for creating sample project or downloading needed version of UE from Epic Games Launcher.

After cloning repo, right-click on `.uproject` file in File Explorer and choose "Switch Unreal Engine version" action, where you need to choose association with your UE5 --> click OK. After that you'll be able to open your project in Rider either via `.sln` or via `.uproject`.
